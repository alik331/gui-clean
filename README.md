## Overview

**GUI Clean** is a powerful browser-based 3D creation application designed with "AI-First" principles. This tool allows users to create and modify 3D objects using natural language commands, thanks to its integration with OpenAI. Built with React, TypeScript, and Babylon.js, GUI Clean emphasizes a clean architecture, focusing on client-side functionality without the need for authentication or a backend database.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Create and manipulate 3D objects through simple text commands.
- **Browser-Based**: Access your projects from any device with a web browser.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project or modify it for your needs without any authentication barriers.
- **No Backend Required**: Enjoy a seamless experience without worrying about server-side complexities.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on various screen sizes, making it user-friendly for all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For improved code quality and maintainability.
- **Babylon.js**: A powerful framework for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- **OpenAI**: To process natural language commands.
- **Vite**: For fast development and building.
- **Zustand**: For state management.

## Getting Started

To get started with GUI Clean, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alik331/gui-clean.git
   cd gui-clean
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Usage

### Creating 3D Objects

To create a 3D object, simply type a command in the input field. For example:

- "Create a cube"
- "Add a sphere"
- "Modify the cube to be red"

The application will interpret your command and render the corresponding 3D object.

### Modifying 3D Objects

You can also modify existing objects. Use commands like:

- "Change the sphere's size to 2"
- "Rotate the cube 45 degrees"
- "Delete the last object"

### Saving and Loading Projects

To save your work, use the "Save" button. You can later load your projects from the "Load" menu. Make sure to check the [Releases](https://github.com/alik331/gui-clean/releases) section for the latest updates and features.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How does the AI integration work?

The AI integration uses OpenAI's models to interpret your commands. When you type a command, it sends a request to the OpenAI API, which returns the necessary actions to perform.

### Can I use GUI Clean offline?

Currently, GUI Clean requires an internet connection to function due to its reliance on external libraries and the OpenAI API.

### Is there a mobile version?

While GUI Clean is accessible on mobile browsers, we are working on optimizing the interface for better usability on smaller screens.

### How can I report a bug?

To report a bug, visit the [Issues](https://github.com/alik331/gui-clean/issues) section and provide as much detail as possible.

### Where can I find the latest releases?
